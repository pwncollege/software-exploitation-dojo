You've taken your first steps into kernel exploitation with [Kernel Security](https://pwn.college/system-security/kernel-security).

Are you ready to kick your knowledge up a notch to understand how real-world Linux kernel exploitation is done?

This module will provide you with the guide that you need to become an expert in Linux kernel exploitation.

**Note 1:** this is a kernel exploitation module, and requires you to run `vm connect` to drop into the virtual machine where the challenge is running. You can get logs using `vm logs` and (in Practice Mode) debug the kernel using `vm debug`.

**Note 2:** for technical reasons, we had to disable virtualization on this module. The VM will be _slow_ --- consider doing heavy tasks like compiling in the normal workspace (e.g., in a terminal where you have _not_ done `vm connect`).
